      <h1 class="display-3">Ruby Version Badger</h1>
      <p class="lead">Badges to show whether your Ruby versions are up to date.</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>They look like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-2.4.1-brightgreen.svg' />
          The very highest Ruby stable version will show as green. You should be using this.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-2.3.4-yellow.svg' />
          The latest patch of previous versions still being supported will be yellow. Think about upgrading.
        </li>
        <li>
          <img src='https://img.shields.io/badge/ruby-2.4.0-red.svg' />
          Everything else will be red. It's either been patched, or isn't supported any more. Update it!
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      To get a badge for your GitHub repository, just use the following image URL format in your README, or similar:
    </p>
    <code>
      https://ruby-version-badger.herokuapp.com/github/{username}/{repository}
    </code>
    <p>
      We'll analyse your repsitory and show the right badge (in SVG). We check the following files, in order:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>Gemfile</code>: we'll read the version in the format <code>ruby "2.4.1"</code>.
      <li><code>.ruby-version</code>: as used by rbenv and RVM.
    </ol>
    <p>
      Other methods like <code>#ruby=2.4.1</code> in the <code>Gemfile</code>,
      <code>.rvmrc</code> and <code>.versions.conf</code> are only used by RVM,
      so aren't supported. The two methods above are supported by many more tools,
      so we'd prefer you used those.
